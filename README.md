ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SamaraGama  
ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in back-end and front-end software development for web applications.  
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and using Ruby on Rails, React, .NET, and Angular (by order of preference and frequency). I also like pure SQL.  
:heart: I love cats, indie games and StackOverflow.  
ğŸ“« You can contact me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samara-gama/) profile.
