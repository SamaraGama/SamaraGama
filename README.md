ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SamaraGama, Software Analysis and Development Undergraduate and Software Engineer.  
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mostly interested in back-end software development for web applications.  
ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on becoming proficient in JavaScript, Java, and their respective most popular libs and frameworks. I also like good old SQL.  
:heart: I love cats, oil painting and gaming.
